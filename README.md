# Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence** repository! This project is a collection of resources, code, and experiments related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you'll find useful examples and documentation here to help you understand and apply AI concepts.
some of the projects needs dataset from kaggle , for each of them you just need to search the name of that dataset in kaggle.com or google and download it , then upload dataset in that project.
